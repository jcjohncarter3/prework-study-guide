# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project got me started on using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and the Command Line. 

My motivation for this project is to help understand how to be a web developer. That way I can switch careers into a new industry. 

This project gave me a lot of answers I still don't fully comprehend, but I know the more I do it the more clear it will become.

I learned a lot, so hopefully I will retain it all.
